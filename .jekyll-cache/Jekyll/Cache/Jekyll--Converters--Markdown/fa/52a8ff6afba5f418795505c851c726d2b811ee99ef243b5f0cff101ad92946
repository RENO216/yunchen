I also worked as a research assistant supervised by Prof. Luxi Yang in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Southeast University, focusing on Reinforcement Learning and recommendation systems. Now my research interest lies in UAV navigation using deep reinforcement learning, specifically interactions and coordinations among drones, and interplay between drones and the environment.</td>
