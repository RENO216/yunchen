      <td>I am currently a graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin , and supervised by Prof. Dr. Robert W. Heath Jr. in Wireless Systems Innovation Laboratory (WSIL). Before this I received B.E. in Information Engineering from Southeast University, China. I also worked as a research assistant supervised by Prof. Luxi Yang in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Southeast University, focusing on Reinforcement Learning and recommendation systems. Now my research interest lies in UAV navigation using deep reinforcement learning, specifically interactions and coordinations among drones, and interplay between drones and the environment.</td>
